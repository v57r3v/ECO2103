DMS ECO2103 Macroeconomics 
Instructions for CA1 Individual Assignment, January 2025 Semester 
The   purpose   of   this   individual   assignment   is   to   enable   you   to   use   relevant   analytical   tools   and macroeconomic concepts   (not   necessarily all of them) that you   have   learnt   in   Lectures   1   to   4.
Choosing Articles as References for Analysis 
Search   through   newspapers, journals,   magazines   or   internet   for THREE articles   that   are   relevant   to the concepts discussed   in   Lecture   1 to   Lecture 4. 
Quote   the   source   of   the   article   in   your   report   or   if   the   article   is   obtained   from   the   web,   quote   the web address. Include a screenshot of the articles in the   reference   list   section. 
You   have the flexibility to   choose   (a)   all   3   articles   from   one   country   or   (b)   3   articles   from various countries. But only articles selected from 1 NOVEMBER 2024 onwards will be accepted. 
The articles selected should be in English and   based   on the   following   topics:
Article   1 -   Lecture Topic   1:   Introduction   to   Macroeconomics, GDP and   Economic Growth
Article 2 -   Lecture Topic 2:   Inflation   and the   Price   Level
Article 3 -   Lecture Topic 3: Wages   and   Unemployment 
OR 
Lecture Topic 4: Saving, Capital   Formation,   Financial   Markets and   Financial System
Each   article   should   deal   with   a   different    macroeconomic aspect   of   the country (for   example,   GDP growth,   labour   productivity,   wages   and   unemployment,   price   level   and   inflation   or   national   saving   and   capital   formation). 
Analyzing your Country 
For    each    of      the      3      articles,      summarize      the      article      first      and      followed       by    an      analysis      of      the   macroeconomic    performance    of    the    country      based      on      the      article.      The      analysis      must      cross-   reference to concepts discussed   in one   particular   lecture   topic. 
You    are    required    to      use      the      lecture      notes      and      textbook      to      help      you      better      illustrate      your   analysis.   If   you   extract   exact   phrases   or   sentences,   please   put   them   in   quotation   marks   in   your   report. 
Explain   your   understanding   of   the   article   using   the   economic   concept   and   knowledge   discussed   in   the   lecture.    Establish   the   linkage   between   the   article   and   the   economic   concept   under   the particular   lecture session and topic.   Draw diagrams to support   your   analysis   if   needed.
Writing your Report 
Write   a   summary   report for   each   country   based   on your   analysis.   Combine   and   organize   all your   work   in a single word   document.
